# Dutch vs. Non-Dutch Statistical Test + Proposer vs. Responder Test

For more information on the historical background/theory, research strategy-ultimatum test in economics. 

Design: Every person has to answer four questions: two as the responder and two as the proposer. The proposer is offerd an amount in euros and has to offer a part of it to the responder (from zero to full amount). If the responder rejects, both of them get nothing. If the responder accepts, both will share the total amount as agreed. 

In a strategy game, the responder answers what is the minimum amount he would accept of the total payoff before the proposer offer him anything. This format increases rejection rates and intuitive thinking rather than logical thinking in responders.

This code also tests for difference between Dutch and Non-Dutch people, for all classes of responders/proposers. 

Finally, this code produces plots, linear regressions and tables and exports it to a Google Slides API to update the presentation automatically. This is useful for this experiment since the results will be shown to the class right after the experiment, making the analysis faster and more reliable.
